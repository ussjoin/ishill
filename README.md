# Ishill: a Theme for Hugo That Makes Zines

This is a Hugo theme that lets you turn Markdown into impressed, double-side-printable, saddle-stiched (stapled in the middle) zines, while also still being a wey to publish the same content on the Web, for free.

This README is a very unpolished sketch of what it needs to be. To sum up, I need to write a README that's short for people who know what Hugo and GitLab/GitHub Pages are, and why this is useful. Then I need to write one that starts with "you know how to use basic computer stuff, and you want to make zines that are mostly writing and less design." Both are important user cases to me, and both are captured by Ishill.

Because this is a Theme That Makes Zines, I expect mostly in this document to point to a zine in the [exampleSite](./exampleSite/) folder demonstrating how to use this theme's features while also being a printed zine. That's also in draft, but go check it out, it's a bit more verbose.

A request: if you start using this, send me an email or an issue here on GitLab/GitHub. If you do, I'll probably link to you here in this README, or in another place. And I'll be fascinated to see what you come up with.
